## Overview

This project showcases my ability to handle **large datasets (1.1M+ entries)** effectively, applying **deep data exploration, cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization** techniques. With this project, I have demonstrated the capability to build end-to-end **data analysis pipelines** and **interactive dashboards**, leveraging **Python, Pandas, Streamlit**, and advanced visualization techniques.

The primary goal of this project is to uncover valuable insights from Amazon's e-commerce dataset, which includes features such as ratings, product categories, prices, and discounts.

**Key Focus Areas:**
- Handling large datasets with 1.1M+ entries and 145 features.
- Cleaning and preprocessing data, including outlier detection and feature engineering.
- Developing interactive dashboards for insights visualization using Streamlit.
- Employing advanced statistical and visual techniques for in-depth analysis.

## Features
1. **Data Loading and Understanding**:
   - Loaded and merged **140 CSV files** to form a comprehensive dataset.
   - Performed column analysis for common and unique features across product categories.

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values with various imputation techniques.
   - Detected and processed outliers in pricing and rating data.
   - Conducted data type conversions and deduplication.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - Created derived features like `discount_percentage`, `price_difference`, and `weighted_rating`.
   - Developed interaction terms like `discount_rating_interaction` and `price_rating_interaction` for deeper insights.

4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Performed univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis using visualizations like **box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps**.
   - Analyzed price distributions, rating trends, and correlations between key product attributes.

5. **Advanced Visualizations**:
   - Built a **correlation heatmap** for numerical features.
   - Created **box plots** and **scatter plots** to uncover relationships between prices, ratings, and categories.
   - Generated word clouds and category-based heatmaps to enhance storytelling.

6. **Insights & Storytelling**:
   - Delivered actionable insights regarding customer satisfaction, discount strategies, and product performance.
   - Identified key product categories for business improvement based on customer feedback and ratings.

7. **Dashboard Creation**:
   - Designed and implemented a **fully interactive dashboard** using Streamlit for **real-time data exploration and visualization**.

## Demo Video

I have recorded a demo video showcasing the **interactive dashboard** in action. The video demonstrates key insights and functionalities of the dashboard, such as filtering by product categories, viewing pricing trends, and analyzing customer ratings.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/amazon-dataset-eda-dashboard.git

2. **Install the required packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   
3. **Run the Streamlit dashboard**:
  ```bash
   streamlit run amazon_dataset.py
   ```

## Technologies Used
  - **Python:** Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
  - **Streamlit:** Dashboard creation
  - **Data Handling:** Over 1 million records, CSV merging, Parquet and CSV formats for efficient large dataset management
  - **Visualization:** Box plots, scatter plots, heatmaps, word clouds

## Results & Impact
  - Efficiently handled a **massive dataset (1.1M+ rows)**, cleaned, engineered features, and provided meaningful insights.
  - Developed a comprehensive dashboard allowing users to explore the dataset interactively.
  - Uncovered insights about product ratings, price discounts, and customer preferences, potentially guiding business strategies.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates my proficiency in working with large datasets and developing data pipelines. I have focused on providing valuable insights through exploratory data analysis, data cleaning, and visualization, complemented by a fully interactive dashboard.
